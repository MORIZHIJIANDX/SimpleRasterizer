# SimpleRasterizer
## Introduction
  This project is simple 3D realtime software renderer based on rasterization. The basic D3D11 render pipeline is implemented in it. In addition, it supports multiple render targets and multiple shader resources. The render contains the following pipeline functionsï¼š
  * Vertex Shading
  * Homogeneous Clipping
  * Half-Space Triangle Rasterization
  * Perspective Corrected Interpolation
  * Z-Buffer Testing
  * Pixle Shading
  * Texture Mapping
  
## Requirement
  * Microsoft Visual Studio 2017
